Thought Haven Core
===

Data abstractions and helpers around the official Microsoft Azure library so that cloud storage development feels more like working with POCOs, not TableEntities, etc.

Bridge the gap between Azure table storage and the repository pattern. Pass in a POCO, configure entities keys, and you have an ICrudStore. Also, guarantee that your app only checks for a table or blob container's existence once per instance.
